  Plone Content Export and Import
</h1>

Package supporting the export and import of content, principals, relations, and translations from and to a Plone site.

## Introduction

This package is a slimmer version of the awesome [collective.exportimport](https://github.com/collective/collective.exportimport).

While `collective.exportimport` supports older Plone versions and Python 2, and also takes care of data conversion -- i.e.: from Archetypes to Dexterity -- this package focus only on latest Plone and Python.
